Someday:
- Determine whether newkey thread called from GUI or hotkey (GuiControlGet,blah - if blah, then...?)
- Import/Export bundles
- Create bundled interface in Texter management - lets you enable/disable a bundle, add or remove to any bundle, etc.
- Update everything so it's consistent with new bundled structure
- Add autoclose options for brackets, parenthesis, double-quote - turn on and off in preferences
- For bundles, create an active directory that updates what's enabled at any time
- Move old replacements to their own directory
- Custom triggers?
- Fix gui weirdness for some ppl?
- Export/Import via .ini files?
- remove punctuation limitations so users can include puncutation in hotstrings - currently this doesn't work b/c scripts are saved as .txt files, so are limited by Windows naming conventions.  AutoClip had a solution for this (hexify), but not sure I want to get rid of my convention - like being able to identify by text file.
- Add buttons/dropdown/something in Hotkey creation for insertion of clipboard, cursor, dates, time variables
- Enable/Disable by application

Features/fixes for 0.4 release:s
x Made hotstrings case sensitive
x Added Prompts
x Work out SendPlay and SendInput discrepencies (maybe make it available in Prefs so that it can work in Synergy)
		- SendPlay is better if you're using just one computer/not using Synergy (for example, it buffers text so you can type
			while the replacement is working and it's sent when the Send is complete
		- If you are using Synergy, SendInput/SendEvent need to be used.
x Make replacement sound optional
