Features/fixes for 0.3 release:
- Fix blank hotstring bug
- Import/Export set of replacements.
- Automatically check for updates
- Printable formatted list of hotstrings
- Add autoclose options for brackets, parenthesis, double-quote - turn on and off in preferences
- Clear input on mouse-clicks; so space, tab, enter, etc. aren't the only shortcuts that clear input and it works more as would be expected - e.g., when you've been typing in another window and then click to a new window, unless your last keystrokes were enter, space, or tab, the input string won't have cleared so it may not work as expected.


Features/fixes for 0.2 release:
x Add option to run at startup
x Compatibility mode & clipboard mode
x Incorporate Dustin's date/time variables
x Change standard mode to SendRaw
x Save last-used trigger as default for next hotstring
x Turned off AutoTrim so that spaces at the end of replacements are retained
x Double-click systray icon launches management

Someday list:
- Get a good designer to improve interface and art design (e.g., icon)
- remove punctuation limitations so users can include puncutation in hotstrings - currently this doesn't work b/c scripts are saved as .txt files, so are limited by Windows naming conventions.  AutoClip had a solution for this (hexify), but not sure I want to get rid of my convention - like being able to identify by text file.
- Add buttons/dropdown/something in Hotkey creation for insertion of clipboard, cursor, dates, time variables

Low priority bugs:
- Check oversized fonts (see http://lifehacker.com/software/texter/lifehacker-code-texter-windows-238306.php#c1047305)
