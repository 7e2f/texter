Features for next release:
- Add option to run at startup
- Compatibility mode & clipboard mode
- Incorporate Dustin's date/time variables
- Change standard mode to to SendRaw

Someday list:
- Automatically check for updates
- Get a good designer to improve interface and art design (e.g., icon)
- Printable formatted list of hotstrings
- remove punctuation limitations so users can include puncutation in hotstrings - currently this doesn't work b/c scripts are saved as .txt files, so are limited by Windows naming conventions.  AutoClip had a solution for this (hexify), but not sure I want to get rid of my convention - like being able to identify by text file.
- Add autoclose options for brackets, parenthesis, double-quote - turn on and off in preferences
- Clear input on mouse-clicks; so space, tab, enter, etc. aren't the only shortcuts that clear input and it works more as would be expected.

Low priority bugs:
- Check oversized fonts (see http://lifehacker.com/software/texter/lifehacker-code-texter-windows-238306.php#c1047305)
