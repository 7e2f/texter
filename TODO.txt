Next time:
- Determine whether newkey thread called from GUI or hotkey (GuiControlGet,blah - if blah, then...?)
- Prompts?
- Import/Export bundles
- Create bundled interface in Texter management - lets you enable/disable a bundle, add or remove to any bundle, etc.
- Update everything so it's consistent with new bundled structure
- Add autoclose options for brackets, parenthesis, double-quote - turn on and off in preferences
- For bundles, create an active directory that updates what's enabled at any time
- Move old replacements to their own directory

Someday list:
- Get a good designer to improve interface and art design (e.g., icon)
- remove punctuation limitations so users can include puncutation in hotstrings - currently this doesn't work b/c scripts are saved as .txt files, so are limited by Windows naming conventions.  AutoClip had a solution for this (hexify), but not sure I want to get rid of my convention - like being able to identify by text file.
- Add buttons/dropdown/something in Hotkey creation for insertion of clipboard, cursor, dates, time variables
- Add Sleep/Delay feature in script mode
- Enable/Disable by application
- Clear input on mouse-clicks; so space, tab, enter, etc. aren't the only shortcuts that clear input and it works more as would be expected - e.g., when you've been typing in another window and then click to a new window, unless your last keystrokes were enter, space, or tab, the input string won't have cleared so it may not work as expected.

Low priority bugs:
- Check oversized fonts (see http://lifehacker.com/software/texter/lifehacker-code-texter-windows-238306.php#c1047305)
